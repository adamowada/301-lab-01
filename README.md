# Welcome to my lab 01 for Code 301 

The purpose of this website is to practice my responsive web design skills. The website has two modes, mobile and desktop. The mobile view will shift into desktop when the browser detects a viewport width of at least 768 pixels wide. Past 960 pixels wide, the elements will center on the screen.
